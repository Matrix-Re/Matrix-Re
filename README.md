I'm a dedicated software engineering student with a deep enthusiasm for the art of software editing and design. I find joy in shaping code into well-crafted solutions, transforming concepts into functional and visually appealing software. Let's code with creativity! ðŸš€

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string name = "Anas";
        string role = "student software developer";

        Console.WriteLine($"Hi, I'm {name}, I'm a {role}");
    }
}
